== Overview

This example illustrates how to configure camel to act as a service mediator/proxy/esb.  

In this architecture, the camel message router acts as an itermediary between client requests and the service being proxied.  

Client -> Camel -> PingService

== Usage

cd example-service
mvn jetty:run

cd example-camel
mvn jetty:run

Open web services explorer or soap ui and test the wsdl in example-service/src/main/resources/ping.wsdl.  Send a request to http://localhost:8080/ws/PingService.jws and watch camel forward it to the actual service running on port 8081.
